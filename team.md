- We waited for Hayden's lecture to see if he was going to explain more about the project.
- After considering the tasks and files we need to work with, we set up tasks on the board, each task for each file i.e channel.py, auth.py. server.py. channels.py, etc.
- We gave a due date for each of us to select the files we are going to work with and for each person to take up reasonable load.

    For sprint 1:

    Raymond: channel.py
    Sunny: message.py
    Dan: auth.py, user.py and server.py (in sprint 1, server.py is due on Mon, 23/3/2020)

- As we plan to have 2 sprints where the files will be passed to other team members for the second sprint, we set ourselves due date for Friday 20th March 2020.
- There are also files such as helper.py and data.json that we did not allocate originally but came up during progress. A team member usually volunteers to take responsiblity for these files although sometimes it may change.
- In our team Dan is responsible for helper.py which contain function decorator functions although some files may be done with individual style and may require some integration towards finish.
- Raymond is responsible for common data file such as data.py and data.json. These files are also developed as we go and responsible person may change depending on need.
