- We waited for Hayden's lecture to see if he was going to explain more about the project.

- After considering the tasks and files we need to work with, we set up tasks on the board, each task for each file i.e channel.py, auth.py. server.py. channels.py, etc.

- We gave a due date for each of us to select the files we are going to work with and for each person to take up reasonable load.

- As we plan to have 2 sprints where the files will be passed to other team members for the second sprint, we set ourselves due date for Friday 20th March 2020.

- Other responsibilities such as implementing function decorator will be at first done individually and will be compiled as we approach finish.
    - Communication is required here as some function decorators are common between people. So as to not double up on work.

- Common data file such as data.py and data.json are developed as we go and responsible person may change depending on need.

- Purpose of function decorators => authenticate, raise Exceptions. Changed the approach to function decorators from authenticating the entire function's parameters (e.g. @authenticate_login) to authenticating individual parameters for re-usability of function decorators (e.g. @authenticate_email, @authenticate_password).
